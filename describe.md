## Describe()
The **describe()** function in PySpark is a very useful tool when you are doing exploratory data analysis, as it computes basic statistics for numeric and string columns1. 
This includes 
count, mean, standard deviation (stddev), minimum (min), and maximum (max) values12. 
If no columns are given, this function computes statistics for all numerical or string columns1.

Here’s when and where you might use it:

**When**
You typically use describe() when you’re doing exploratory data analysis and you want to get a quick understanding of the distribution of your data. It helps you understand the central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution12.

**Where**
You apply the describe() function on a DataFrame. For example, if you have a DataFrame named df, you can call df.describe() to get summary statistics of all columns in the DataFrame. If you want to get summary statistics of specific columns, you can pass the column names as arguments, like df.describe('column1', 'column2')1.

Remember that while describe() is a great tool for exploratory data analysis, it’s not meant for detailed statistical analysis. For more advanced statistics or more control over which statistics to compute, consider using the summary() function3. 

Also note that the schema of the resulting DataFrame from describe() is not guaranteed to be stable across different versions of Spark
